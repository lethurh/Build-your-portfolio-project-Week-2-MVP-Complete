During the PLD this week, these are the objectives:

Each team meets with 3 teams they didn’t meet with last week, one at a time for 40 minutes.
During the team-team meeting, each team presents for 20 minutes, then observes for 20 minutes.
When a team is presenting, they share their MVP and walk through code any they’ve implemented and technical choices they have made.
When a team is observing, they ask questions, share observations, and code review. Act more as an interviewer than a mentor.
